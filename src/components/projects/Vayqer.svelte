<h4>About</h4>
<p>
	A road trip platform designed for Swedes to explore their own country first. It featured
	handpicked destinations across Sweden, curated through an admin portal and accessible to all
	paying users.
</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>
	My most ambitious project yet—though it currently does not see the light of day, it still holds a
	special place in my heart. Vayqer was my first major software development endeavor, featuring
	custom authentication and authorization, multiple frontends (iOS, Android, and web), and a .NET C#
	backend. With no prior experience working on a project of this scale (and no AI to assist me!), I
	navigated through documentation of varying quality, sought advice from a handful of helpful
	people, and gained invaluable experience in software development and project architecture.
</p>
<h4>What I learned</h4>
<p>
	Keep it simple—don’t overcomplicate things, and definitely don’t use three different tech stacks
	for cross-platform development when you are a single developer!
