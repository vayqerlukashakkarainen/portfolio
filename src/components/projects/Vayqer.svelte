<h4>About</h4>
<p>
	A roadtrip platform aimed for Swedes to discover Sweden first. Handpicked destinations, all across
	Sweden was entered through the admin portal and available for all paying users.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>
	My most ambigous project yet, even tho it currently does not see the light of day, the project
	still remains vibrant in my heart. Vayqer was my first real software development project,
	including custom authorizesation and authentication, multiple frontend (iOS, Android and web) and
	a backend powered by dot net C#. Since having no prior knowledge for a project at this scale (and
	no AI to help me!), I stumbled across documentation in varius quality, talked to a handfull or
	helpful people and gather large amount of experience for software development and project
	architecture.

<h4>Lesson learnt</h4>
<p>Do not overcomplicate things, and do not use 3 different tech stacks for cross platform!</p>
