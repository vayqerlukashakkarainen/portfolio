<h4>About</h4>
<p>
	This project started as a request from my partner for an e-commerce site selling handcrafted
	decorations for children’s rooms. I chose WordPress and WooCommerce as the most straightforward,
	cost-effective, and well-supported solution—allowing for easy maintenance and administration
	without my ongoing involvement.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>Meeting my partner’s standards and expectations, while making sure not to let her down. :)</p>
